### Workflow description:

In the following repository you can find the detection of defect location of metal pipes with machine learning approaches. It is available 245 measurements (magnetic flaw detection) of metal pipes with different defect types (for example - corrosion, scratch, etc).

For each measurements the following info is available:

        id - measurement identificator;
        time - measurement time, sec.;
        ch0, ch1, ch2 - recordings from three channels over pipe length.
        target - external (OD) or internal (ID) type of defect.

### Content:
    
- EDA (exploratory data analysis) and helpful insights.

- Supervised classification.

- Unsipervised clustering.
